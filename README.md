# OpenCVDetection
Experimentation with different opencv libraries 

## User Guide
This program creates 3 windows<br/>
One displays an image from your webcam.<br/>
One shows what pixels are still being registered.<br/>
The final window has a set of sliders.<br/>
Moving the sliders around affects the other windows real time.<br/>
Finally if a rectangle is recognized on the screeen it will print to your console.<br/>

## Skills learned
This coding adventure taught me a little bit about openCV libraries.<br/>
Ultimately my goal was to securely recognize a rectangle on the screen.<br/>
While it technically does so, I was dissapointed with the effectiveness.<br/>
I did manage to match specific colors, and often could recognize a rectangle<br/>
if the object had a distinct color.<br/>

I am excited to see what else I can do with image processing.<br/>
